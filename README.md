## About The App

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game consisting of a 3x3 grid in which players take turns making their mark (cross or circle) until either one player achieves a connected line of 3 marks or the board state prevents either player from achieving a line of 3 marks which results in a draw.

This project was built with ReactJS UI.

## What I Would Do If I Had More Time

I will definitely include a back-end for this app, so that it has it's own database and has a memory of what it's doing. I will have added in a reset/clear game button so the player can restart at any point, rather than needing to complete the game before they can do so. Also, a preview/history of how the gameplay went for that specific round.
